<div class="not-cool"></div>

    <p>Guinness uses isinglass in its production, derived from the swim bladders
        of fish. The isinglass helps the sediment settle faster, and is not used
        not for flavour or texture. Some tiny particles of fish will remain in
        the final drink. This makes it unsuitable for vegetarian and vegan
        diets, as well as anyone else who doesn't like the idea of fish being
        used to make their pint.</p>
